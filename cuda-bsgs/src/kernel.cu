};

// --- Conceptual Kernel Optimizations ---
//
// 1. Merged Baby-Step Lookup and Giant-Step Calculation:
//    Instead of two separate kernels or a host-generated table lookup,
//    if the baby step table is small enough to fit in shared memory (or a portion of it),
//    it can be loaded by a block, and then all threads in that block can perform
//    giant step calculations and lookups against this shared table.
//    This reduces global memory access and potentially one kernel launch.
//
// 2. Shared Memory Usage:
//    - A tile of the BabyStepEntry_GPU table could be loaded into shared memory by a thread block.
//    - Each thread in the block would then compare its calculated giant step point (Q_j)
//      against all entries in the shared memory tile.
//    - This requires synchronization (e.g., __syncthreads()) after loading and during search.
//
// 3. Warp Efficiency and Memory Access:
//    - Coalesced Memory Access: When threads in a warp access global memory,
//      they should access contiguous memory locations to maximize bandwidth.
//      This is important when loading the baby step table or accessing other global data.
//    - Shared Memory Bank Conflicts: Access to shared memory should be designed to avoid
//      bank conflicts. If multiple threads in a warp access different words from the
//      same bank, it's a conflict. Striding access can sometimes help.
//    - Thread Divergence: Conditional statements (if/else) where threads in the same
//      warp take different paths can reduce efficiency. Minimize divergence where possible.
//      For the search loop, if all threads search the same shared data, divergence is less of an issue there.
//
// 4. Point Compression / Hashing for Baby Steps:
//    - Storing full elliptic curve points for baby steps can be memory intensive.
//    - Using compressed points or even hashes of points (if collision resistance is managed)
//      can significantly reduce memory footprint, allowing more baby steps to be stored or
//      larger tiles to fit in shared memory. This means `point_representation` might be a hash.
//
// 5. Kernel Launch Parameters:
//    - Block size (threads_per_block) should typically be a multiple of warpSize (32).
//      Common sizes are 128, 256, 512.
//    - Grid size should be large enough to occupy the GPU. The number of blocks should generally
//      be many times the number of SMs on the GPU.
//    - These parameters are often tuned empirically or using an auto-tuner.
